### whatShouldIDoForLunch.md tips.

Try experimenting with the comparison operators (`<`, `>`, `===`, etc.) in the node REPL, which you can launch using the `node` command in Vagrant.

Work on your code iteratively â€“ that means in small pieces. 

To help you figure out how to use `hungry` and `availableTime` inside your function, try outputting their values to the Terminal as follows.\


```javascript 
function whatToDoForLunch(hungry, availableTime){
    console.log("hungry is", hungry);
    console.log("available time is" availableTime);
}
```
